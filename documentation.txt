ISSUES:

Invalid emails will result in a 500 Error

BASIC:
The files used in the LSLDC COLO Request App Site can be found on dj-1.www.umass.edu in the directory /var/www/html/COLOSite. 

This folder contains most noticeably:
‘colo_env’ - a folder holding the Django virtual environment settings
‘COLOSite’ - a folder holding the settings for the whole site, in which the requestApp lives
‘requestApp’ - a folder holding the app settings 

Individual pages are served by requestApp/views.py which provides Django functionality and serves the HTML CSS templates found in requestApp/static
